# Communicate Data Findings
## by Maryam raafat


## Dataset

> Original dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

> Since our main goal here is EDA , I merged assessing and cleaning steps into one to make it concise and I left the following code here by choice for future references and more understanding of the original and cleaned datasets.

## Data Assessing and Cleaning

> 1. choose subset of features important 
> 2. drop duplicated rows based on listing number 
> 3. convert datatypes of TotalTrades and TotalInquiries to int , ListingCreationDate to datetime
> 4. removed rows without ProsperRating
> 5. fill in missing values of occupation and DebtToIncomeRatio
> 6. change listing category numeric to string.

## Summary of Findings

> I expect that the total loan amount will have a negative effect on the APR of the loan: the larger the total loan amount, the lower the APR. I also think that the borrowers stated monthly income, loan term, Prosper rating, employment status will also have effects on the APR.
Employment status and occupation will affect out ProsperRating and loan Amount.

> The distribution of APR looks multimodal. A small peak centered at 0.1, a large peak centered at 0.2. There is also a small peak centered 0.3. Additionally, there is a very shape peak between 0.35 and 0.36. Only very few loans have APR greater than 0.43.

> Distribution has unimodal peak around 0.2 with unusual peak around 0.25 which indicates most people prefer 1:4 ratio of debt to Income which is a good thing.

> The distribution of stated monthly income is severely right screwed, with stated monthly income less than 30k. and peak around 6K. There are some outliers around 100K and 50K which should be removed.

> The correlation coefficient of borrower APR and loan original amount is -0.323, the scatter plot also shows that these two variables are negatively correlated, which agrees with our hypothesis, that is the more the loan amount, the lower the APR. The loan original amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, it makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income could loan more money.

> The borrower APR decreases with the better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR. Borrowers with better rating also have larger monthly income and loan amount. Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers.

> The employment status variable do not have enough data on part-time, retired and not employed borrowers to show its interaction with term and Prosper rating variables. But we can see that there is a interaction between term and Prosper rating. Proportionally, there are more 60 month loans on B and C ratings. There is only 36 months loans for HR rating borrowers.

> The loan amount increases with better rating. The borrower APR decreases with better rating. Interestingly, the relationship between borrower APR and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings are increased from HR to A or better. This may because people with A or AA ratings tend to borrow more money, increasting APR could prevent them borrow even more and maximize the profit. But people with lower ratings tend to borrow less money, decreasing APR could encourage them to borrow more.

> Interestingly, the borrower APR decrease with the increase of borrow term for people with HR-C raings. But for people with B-AA ratings, the APR increase with the increase of borrow term.

> For stated monthly income, it doesn't seem like there is a interaction effect between term and rating, the pattern of term is similar among different ratings. But for loan amount, there is a interaction between term and rating. We can see that with better Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms increases, the increase amplitude of loan amount between terms also becomes larger.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> January has the highest number of loans listed as expected from starting of new year , whereas april sees the least number of loans listed.
> There is an upward trend in loans listed with each passing year

> The distribution of APR looks multimodal. A small peak centered at 0.1, a large peak centered at 0.2. There is also a small peak centered 0.3. Additionally, there is a very shape peak between 0.35 and 0.36. Only very few loans have APR greater than 0.43.

> Distribution has unimodal peak around 0.2 with unusual peak around 0.25 which indicates most people prefer 1:4 ratio of debt to Income which is a good thing.

> At different size of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the range of APR decrease with the increase of loan amount. Overall, the borrower APR decrease with increase of loan amount

> The borrower APR decreases with the increasingly better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR.


> The borrower APR changes with the occupation,Interestingly with student in technical schools having least and college sophomores having highest average rating.

> Interestingly, the borrower APR decrease with the increase of borrow term for people with HR-C raings. But for people with B-AA ratings, the APR increase with the increase of borrow term.
